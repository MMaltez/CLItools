# CLItools
Tools meant to be used from the command line (text terminal).

- freeinitials -- Shows letters that haven't been used as initials for files in current directory. Unique initials reduce type by using command autocomplete features.
- space2tab -- Convert a space indented source code to tab indented source code.
- caseConflict -- Searchs for filenames that may cause case conflict when transfered to a case insensitive file system.
- sequentialRename -- Changes images names to decimal numbers that will order from the oldest (001) to newest file.
